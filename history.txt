1. 能够加载用户自定义jar的实现
需要实现：
1. 前端接受文件上传，后台接受文件，并且复制到指定文件夹下
2. 动态加载jar文件，创建db实例

完成hive的db接口实现

TODO:argument generator,也即包括怎么配置，动态展示时，展示什么

SELECT f1.uid, COUNT(f2.uid) as num FROM 
(SELECT a.followeeID AS uid FROM friendList as a JOIN friendList as  b 
ON (a.followeeID = b.uid) 
WHERE a.uid = b.followeeID AND a.uid = '1216766752') as f 
JOIN friendList as f2 ON (f2.uid = f.uid) 
JOIN friendList as f1 ON (f1.followeeID = f2.uid) 
WHERE  f1.followeeID = f2.uid AND 
f1.uid = f2.followeeID AND 
f1.uid!='1216766752' AND 
f1.uid!=f.uid  GROUP BY f1.uid  ORDER BY num DESC;

SELECT f1.uid, COUNT(f2.uid) as num FROM
