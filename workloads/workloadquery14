# Benchmark for Social Media Analysis
# Workload QueryN: workload for queryN(N=1,2,3...19)
#   Application example: 
#   
#   Operation count(required): the number of queries to execute
#   Workload(required): the name of the workload class to use                    
#   QueryN proportion(required): the proportion of QueryN in all queries. In workloadqueryN, queryNproportion is 1 and no other queryMproportions(M!=N) need listed since no mixed workload(queries) is required.
#   Return count(not required in Query4&5): the number of returned records for a single query, which can be used in SELECT TOP clause.options:10, 50, 100.
#   Time span(not required in Query1&2&3&4&5&8): time span specified in a query. options:h(one hour),d(one day),w(one week),y(one year)
